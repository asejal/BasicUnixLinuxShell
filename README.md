# BasicUnixLinuxShell
Implemented a simple shell that handles internal commands and like ‘cd’, ‘echo’, ‘history’, ‘pwd’ and ‘exit’ directly some of their flags and external commands like ‘ls’, ‘cat’, ‘date’, ‘rm’ and ‘mkdir’ and some of their flags through individual programs by creating a new process, using the fork() and execl() family system calls to run the individual program.
