cd: cd [-L]
	cd [--help]
	Change the shell working directory.

	Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the root directory represented by '/'. Initially the directory is the directory in which the shell file is. For moving to a directory which has a space in the name use the backward slash ('\') instead of the space.

	Options:
	-L		force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic links in DIR after processing instances of '..'
	--help	open this menu for more information on the cd command for this basic Linux/Unix shell

	The dafualt is to follow the '-L' command and behave as if it was specified.

	Exit Status:
	Returns 1 if the directory is changed and unless an error due to invalid option occurs in which case, it returns 0.
